# Audio Effects Playground

Sandbox for learning the Web Audio API.

Using the [Audio Input Effects](https://github.com/cwilso/Audio-Input-Effects) repo as a base/inspiration, first stripping down to simplest functionality, then re-creating the existing app, and then building from there.

To see it in action, open the index.html file in Firefox (other browser support is iffy).

## Further Project Goals

* Add additional sound effects.
* Allow users to record sounds, then apply distortions (rather than just from live input).
* Allow users to share uploaded sounds.
* Convert to an Angular app.

## Stretch Goals

* SoundCloud integration
* Visualizations using SVG instead of Canvas
